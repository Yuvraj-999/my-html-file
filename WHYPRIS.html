                The **Artist in Residence (A.I.R)** program is one of the most exquisite and admirable processes at Priyadarshani International School. Designed to bring professional artists into our school, this program benefits students from grades 3 to 10. Our primary goal is to enhance arts education by fostering creativity and self-expression over a 10 to 11-day period, under the direct guidance of a professional artist.
                <br><br>
                Students actively join committees based on their interests, exploring hidden talents in dance, music, and visual arts, while developing their aesthetic sense of performing arts. With the help of renowned theatre artists, they learn intricate detailsâ€”from understanding stage dynamics and dialogue delivery to perfecting acting and dancing skills, and preparing costumes and props.
                <br><br>
                This program also significantly improves students' communication and convincing skills through the sponsorship committee, empowering them to independently raise funds for their performances. Working with the light and sound committee at a young age, students gain technical awareness and learn to manage their shows seamlessly. They take initiative, fulfilling duties as Assistant Directors (ADs), working alongside and guiding the entire crew for perfection and efficiency.
                <br><br>
                This unique creative process also creates memorable moments that serve as anchor points for core content and information. Students explore various literary genres, read extensively, imagine boundlessly, and create musical acts or dramas to shape their imaginations. They get the valuable opportunity to express themselves by scripting the storyline of their acts.
                <br><br>
                Throughout these 10 days, students work tirelessly in different committees, yet thoroughly enjoy the process with their peers. This experience enhances essential values such as **teamwork, adaptability, accountability**, and **respect** towards peers, subtly integrating content scrutiny. It enriches and completes the emotional, social, physical, cognitive, and spiritual development of every student involved.
                <br><br>
                So far, Priyadarshani International School has successfully conducted two A.I.R. programs, exceeding our expectations. Our students have demonstrated remarkable professionalism and intellectual growth, flourishing with excellent content knowledge and strong character development.

                Priyadarshani International School proudly celebrates **Shivaji Maharaj Jayanti** with great enthusiasm and reverence each year. This significant event commemorates the birth anniversary of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the great Maratha warrior king, who is revered for his valor, administrative skills, and vision for Swaraj (self-rule).
                <br><br>
                Our celebrations typically involve a variety of cultural programs and educational activities designed to instill in our students a deep appreciation for his legacy and teachings. Students participate in historical skits depicting key events from his life, recite poems, and deliver speeches highlighting his principles of justice, courage, and leadership.
                <br><br>
                The event serves as an excellent platform for students to learn about Indian history and the profound impact of Shivaji Maharaj on the nation. It also encourages them to embody his virtues in their own lives, fostering a sense of pride in their heritage and inspiring them to become responsible and ethical citizens. Through these celebrations, we aim to keep the spirit of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj alive and continue to educate the younger generation about his invaluable contributions to society.
